//A form to register new admins.
//  A form that sends a `POST` request to `/admin/register`.
// After an admin performs an action (like registering a new admin), you might want to navigate them back to the `AdminDashboard` or show a success message. This can be done using the `useNavigate` hook and state management within each component.
