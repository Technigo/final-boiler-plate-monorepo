// SUMMARY

// This file sets up routing for a React application using React Router. It imports the necessary components and defines routes for different URL paths, associating each path with a specific component to be rendered when that path is accessed. The catch-all route with the path "*" is used to handle routes that do not match any of the specified paths, rendering the "NotFound" component in such cases.
