# stretch goal: user will gather dandelion and visit dandelion shop. might buy dream made of happy instance

# google 'you are alone in the dark ...' . might get inspiration. there was something there but didnt had time to get look into it

# originally got inspired of japanese webgame 'battleroyale' to get idea of grid. difference between that and this project is, that project has visible grid. which i dont. 

# formally got inspired of survival sandbox games, especially certain one that made of two swedish college students. ill not name it bcs bit embarassed to get linked if i am having chance even. but since that game is my all, my project comes from the time i put into interact the world that exists there. 

# backbone of this is technigo's final boiler plate monorepo. but since the time i used contains many tears and doubts, i can say that i want to get rid of that as soon as possible. but still thanks to there, because the reason i worked is that i got chance to connect technigo. if i werent, there is no project that have chance to be built. i thought many times that reason i work is because i am in this education, connected to here somehow, because there was nothing that made me work past in my life other than the moment that i met technigo. was having problem connecting to the other side of world, and while that i met technigo. bcs i could be bit neutral to technigo, compared to many other organization that i had in my life, i could make myself start doing something. so probably this can be the biggest progress of my life. sorry if i complained a lot. was not happy for many times. but i needed you guys to make me alive. to not let me die in the dark, with nowhere, no one.
