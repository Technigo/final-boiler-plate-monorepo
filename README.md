# Project Overview

Welcome to our final project! We've built a Long-Distance Ridesharing App for the Swedish market. Here's a quick guide to what we did.

# Tech Stuff

    Frontend: We used React to make the app user-friendly.
    Backend: The behind-the-scenes magic is powered by Node.js.
    Database: We store all our cool data in MongoDB.

# Making It Look Good

    Navigation: We used React Router so you can smoothly move around.
    Compatibility: Our app plays nice with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    Responsiveness: It looks good on your phone, tablet, or computer.
    Accessibility: Everyone can use it â€“ we followed the rules!

# Design Vibes

    Structure: Everything is neat and tidy, with consistent spacing.
    Typography: Text looks good and is the same size everywhere.
    Colors: We picked some nice colors to make things look pretty.
    Adaptability: The app adjusts to fit whatever device you're using.

# Conclusion

Our Piggyback App is the result of hard work during the Technigo Web Development Bootcamp. Check it out and enjoy the ride!
