## Final Project

We built an application designed for Swedish-speaking children aged 8-9 to practice different subjects such as Math, Swedish, and English. Our main goal was to develop a flexible code base that can grow over time to include more subjects and subcategories.

Users can create accounts to track their progress and view score summaries. All scores are stored in a database, ensuring that each time a user logs in, their scores are updated. This helps them track their progress and continue learning effectively

Our mission is to create a fun app that supports children's educational growth in an engaging way.

### Next step

The next step would be to add more subjects and enhancing user features, such as allowing them to update their profile information and delete their account.

## The Code

In our project, we've used React for the frontend and Styled Components for managing dynamic styling. For the backend, we used Express.js and integrated with a MongoDB database to store user progress and scores.
We also used Context API to manage global state, and found the useForm hook to be very effective for handling forms

## The problem

Our main issue was that we didn't set up a clear design structure for the project before jumping into coding. This caused us to lose time and face some misunderstandings along the way. However, we sorted things out by communicating well and sketching out a basic layout. This helped us understand how the PluggIn project should flow and what elements we needed. As a result, we all got on the same page about the project's direction.

We also should have communicated better about connecting the backend with the frontend and how to handle the code structure efficiently and in a DRY manner.
