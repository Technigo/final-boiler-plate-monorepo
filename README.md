# "set up backend first" - by code coach
but im working with frontend currently.
when user start to 'move'
api is supposed to record users place,
so, and then, having need to set up backend
but i think there should be reason, to focus on backend first, and i want to feel that
so lets hope that ill be done the basic frontend thing asap,
and get into, the real thing, called backend.
